# Solidity by Example ERC20 Token

This repository contains two Solidity contracts for an ERC20 token.


## Usage

To use the contracts, you will need to deploy them to a blockchain network. Once you have deployed the contracts, you can interact with them using the following methods:

* `mint(uint amount)`: This method mints `amount` new tokens to the caller's account.
* `burn(uint amount)`: This method burns `amount` tokens from the caller's account.
* `transfer(address recipient, uint amount)`: This method transfers `amount` tokens from the caller's account to the `recipient` account.
* `approve(address spender, uint amount)`: This method approves the `spender` account to spend up to `amount` tokens on behalf of the caller.
* `transferFrom(address sender, address recipient, uint amount)`: This method transfers `amount` tokens from the `sender` account to the `recipient` account, if the `spender` account has been approved to spend at least `amount` tokens on behalf of the `sender`.
